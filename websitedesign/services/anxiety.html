    <h1>ANXIETY</h1>

    <h2>What is an anxiety disorder?</h2>
    <p>An anxiety disorder is a type of mental health condition. If you have an anxiety disorder, you may respond to
        certain things and situations with fear and dread. You may also experience physical signs of anxiety, such as a
        pounding heart and sweating.
        It’s normal to have some anxiety. You may feel anxious or nervous if you have to tackle a problem at work, go to
        an interview, take a test or make an important decision. And anxiety can even be beneficial. For example,
        anxiety helps us notice dangerous situations and focuses our attention, so we stay safe.
        But an anxiety disorder goes beyond the regular nervousness and slight fear you may feel from time to time.

    <h2>What are anxiety disorders?</h2>
    <p>Anxiety disorders are conditions in which anxiety does not go away and can get worse over time, interfering with
        daily activities.</p>
    <h3> An anxiety disorder happens when:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li> Anxiety interferes with your ability to function.</li>
        <li>You often overreact when something triggers your emotions.</li>
        <li>You can’t control your responses to situations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What causes anxiety disorders?</h2>
    <p>Anxiety disorders are like other forms of mental illness. They don’t come from personal weakness, character flaws
        or problems with
        upbringing. But researchers don’t know exactly what causes anxiety disorders. They suspect a combination of
        factors plays a role:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chemical imbalance</li>
        <li>Environmental factors</li>
        <li>Heredity</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chemical imbalance </h3>
    <p> Severe or long-lasting stress can change the chemical balance that controls your mood.
        Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period can lead to an anxiety disorder</p>
    <h3>Environmental factors</h3>
    <p>Experiencing a trauma might trigger an anxiety disorder, especially in someone who has inherited a higher risk to
        start.</p>
    <h3>Heredity</h3>
    <p>Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. You may inherit them from one or both parents, like eye color.</p>
    <h2>Types of anxiety disorders:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Panic disorder</li>
        <li>Phobias</li>
        <li>Agoraphobia</li>
        <li>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Panic disorder</h3>
    <p>If you have a panic disorder, you get intense, sudden panic attacks. These attacks often feature stronger, more
        intense feelings than other types of anxiety disorders.
        The feelings of terror may start suddenly and unexpectedly or they may come from a trigger, like facing a
        situation you dread. Panic attacks can resemble heart attacks. If there’s
        any chance you’re experiencing a heart attack, go to the emergency room. It’s better to err on the side of
        caution and have a healthcare professional check you.</p>
    <h4>
        During a panic attack, you may experience:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Sweating.</li>
        <li>Heart palpitations (feeling like your heart is pounding).</li>
        <li>Chest pain.</li>
        <li>Feeling of choking, which can make you think you’re having a heart attack or “going crazy.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Panic attacks are very upsetting. People with panic disorder often spend a lot of time worrying about the next
        panic attack. They also try to avoid situations that might trigger an attack.</p>
    <h3>Phobias</h3>
    <p>Phobias are an intense fear of certain situations or objects. Some of these fears may make sense, such as a fear
        of snakes. But often, the level of fear doesn’t match the situation.
        Like with other anxiety disorders, you may spend a lot of time trying to avoid situations that may trigger the
        phobia.</p>
    <p>A specific phobia, or a simple phobia, is an intense fear of a particular object or situation. It may cause you
        to avoid everyday situations. Some specific phobias include fear of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Animals, such as spiders, dogs or snakes.</li>
        <li>Blood.</li>
        <li>Flying.</li>
        <li>Heights.</li>
        <li>Injections (shots).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Agoraphobia</h3>
    <p>If you have agoraphobia, you may have an intense fear of being overwhelmed or unable to get help. Usually, you
        have a fear of two or more of these environments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enclosed spaces.</li>
        <li>Lines or crowds.</li>
        <li>Open spaces.</li>
        <li>Places outside your house.</li>
        <li>Public transportation.</li>
        <p>In severe situations, a person with agoraphobia may not leave the house at all. They’re so terrified of
            having a panic attack in public that they prefer to stay inside</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</h3>
    <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition caused by very stressful, frightening or
        distressing events.</p>
    <h4>Causes of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>serious road accidents.</li>
        <li>violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery.</li>
        <li>serious health problems.</li>
        <li>childbirth experiences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>PTSD can develop immediately after someone experiences a disturbing event, or it can occur weeks, months or even
        years later.</p>
    <h2>Symptoms of anxiety disorders</h2>
    <p>The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere
            with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.</li>
        <li>Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and
            shortness of breath.</li>
        <li>Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do Using caffeine, other substances,
            and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Physical symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cold or sweaty hands.</li>
        <li>Dry mouth.</li>
        <li>Heart palpitations.</li>
        <li>Nausea.</li>
        <li>Numbness or tingling in hands or feet.</li>
        <li>Muscle tension.</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
    </ul>

        <LI>Trouble sleeping.</LI>
    </UL>

    <h2>Managing anxiety</h2>
    <p>Some of the management options for anxiety disorders include:</p>
    <UL>
        <LI>learning about anxiety</LI>
        <LI> mindfulness</LI>
        <LI>relaxation techniques</LI>
        <LI>correct breathing techniques</LI>
        <LI>cognitive therapy</LI>
        <LI>behaviour therapy</LI>
        <LI>counselling</LI>
        <LI>dietary adjustments</LI>
        <LI>exercise</LI>
        <LI>learning to be assertive</LI>
        <LI>building self-esteem</LI>
        <LI>structured problem solving</LI>
        <LI>medication</LI>
        <LI>support groups</LI>
    </UL>

    <h3>Learning about anxiety</h3>
    <p>The old adage ‘knowledge is power’ applies here – learning all about anxiety is central to recovery. For example,
        education includes examining the physiology of the ‘flight-or-fight’ response, which is the body’s way to deal
        with impending danger.
        For people with anxiety disorders, this response is inappropriately triggered by situations that are generally
        harmless. Education is an important way to promote control over symptoms.</p>

    <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
    <p>When feeling anxious, a person can spend a significant amount of time caught up in anxiety-provoking thoughts.
        Mindfulness guides us to bring our attention back to the present moment and unhook from thoughts that may be
        unhelpful.

        Mindfulness is becoming more and more popular as people start to realise how beneficial it is for a number of
        issues. There are many resources available to support you to develop a mindfulness practice.</p>

    <h3>Relaxation techniques</h3>
    <p>A person who feels anxious most of the time has trouble relaxing, but knowing how to release muscle tension can
        be a helpful strategy. Relaxation techniques include:</p>
    <UL>
        <LI>progressive muscle relaxation.</LI>
        <LI>abdominal breathing.</LI>
        <LI>isometric relaxation exercises.</LI>
    </UL>
    <h3>Correct breathing techniques</h3>
    <p>The physical symptoms of anxiety may be triggered by hyperventilation, which raises oxygen levels and reduces the
        amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. Carbon dioxide assists in the regulation of the body’s reaction to
        anxiety and panic.

        It can be helpful for a person who suffers from anxiety to learn how to breathe from their diaphragm, rather
        than their chest, to safeguard against hyperventilation. The key is allowing your belly to expand as you breathe
        in.</p>
    <p>You can make sure you are breathing correctly by placing one hand on your lower abdomen and the other on your
        chest. Correct breathing means your abdomen moves, rather than your chest. It also helps to slow your breathing
        while feeling anxious.

        Some people can find abdominal breathing challenging. There are many other breathing techniques that you can
        try. You can also try to hold your breath for a few seconds. This helps to boost carbon dioxide levels in the
        blood.</p>

    <h3>Cognitive therapy</h3>
    <p>Cognitive therapy focuses on changing patterns of thinking and beliefs that are associated with, and trigger,
        anxiety. For example, a person with a social phobia may make their anxiety worse by negative thoughts such as,
        ‘Everyone thinks I’m boring’.</p>
    <p>The basis of cognitive therapy is that beliefs trigger thoughts, which then trigger feelings and produce
        behaviours. For example, let’s say you believe (perhaps unconsciously) that you must be liked by everyone in
        order to feel worthwhile. If someone turns away from you in mid-conversation, you may think, ‘This person hates
        me’, which makes you feel anxious.</p>
    <p>Cognitive therapy strategies include rational ‘self-talk’, reality testing, attention training, cognitive
        challenging and cognitive restructuring. This includes monitoring your self-talk, challenging unhelpful fears
        and beliefs, and testing out the reality of negative thoughts.</p>

    <h3>Behaviour therapy</h3>
    <p>A major component of behaviour therapy is exposure. Exposure therapy involves deliberately confronting your fears
        in order to desensitise yourself. Exposure allows you to train yourself to redefine the danger or fear aspect of
        the situation or trigger.</p>
    <h4>The steps of exposure therapy may include:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Rank your fears in order, from most to least threatening.</li>
        <li>Choose to work first on one of your least threatening fears.</li>
        <li>Think about the feared situation. Imagine yourself experiencing the situation. Analyse your fears -– what
            are you afraid of?</li>
        <li>Work out a plan that includes a number of small steps – for example, gradually decrease the distance between
            yourself and the feared situation or object, or gradually increase the amount of time spent in the feared
            situation.</li>
        <li>Resist the urge to leave. Use relaxation, breathing techniques and coping statements to help manage your
            anxiety.</li>
        <li>Afterwards, appreciate that nothing bad happened.</li>
        <li>Repeat the exposure as often as you can to build confidence that you can cope.</li>
        <li>When you are ready, tackle another feared situation in the same step-by-step manner.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dietary adjustments</h3>
    <p>The mineral magnesium helps muscle tissue to relax, and a magnesium deficiency can contribute to anxiety,
        depression and insomnia. Inadequate intake of vitamin B and calcium can also exacerbate anxiety symptoms.
        Make sure your daily diet includes foods such as wholegrain cereals, leafy green vegetables and low-fat dairy
        products.</p>
    <p>Nicotine, caffeine and stimulant drugs (such as those that contain caffeine) trigger your adrenal glands to
        release adrenaline, which is one of the main stress chemicals. These are best avoided. Other foods to avoid
        include salt and artificial additives, such as preservatives. Choose fresh, unprocessed foods whenever possible.
    </p>

    <h3>Exercise</h3>
    <p>The physical symptoms of anxiety are caused by the ‘flight-or-fight’ response, which floods the body with
        adrenaline and other stress chemicals. Exercise burns up stress chemicals and promotes relaxation. Physical
        activity is another helpful way to manage anxiety. Aim to do some physical activity at least three to four times
        every week, and vary your activities to avoid boredom.</p>

    <h3>Learning to be assertive</h3>
    <p>Being assertive means communicating your needs, wants, feelings, beliefs and opinions to others in a direct and
        honest manner without intentionally hurting anyone’s feelings. A person with an anxiety disorder may have
        trouble being assertive because they are afraid of conflict or believe they have no right to speak up. However,
        relating passively to others lowers self-confidence and reinforces anxiety. Learning to behave assertively is
        central to developing a stronger self-esteem.</p>

    <h3>Building self-esteem</h3>
    <p>People with anxiety disorder often have low self-esteem. Feeling worthless can make the anxiety worse in many
        ways. It can trigger a passive style of interacting with others and foster a fear of being judged harshly. Low
        self-esteem may also be related to the impact of the anxiety disorder on your life. These problems may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>isolation.</li>
        <li>feelings of shame and guilt.</li>
        <li>depressed mood.</li>
        <li>difficulties in functioning at school, work or in social situations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The good news is you can take steps to learn about and improve your self-esteem. Community support organisations
        and counselling may help you to cope with these problems.</p>
    <h3>Structured problem solving</h3>
    <p>Some people with anxiety disorders are ‘worriers’, who fret about a problem rather than actively solve it.
        Learning how to break down a problem into its various components – and then decide on a course of action – is a
        valuable skill that can help manage generalised anxiety and depression. This is known as structured problem
        solving.</p>

    <h3>Medication</h3>
    <p>It is important that medications are seen as a short-term measure, rather than the solution to anxiety disorders.

        Research studies have shown that psychological therapies, such as cognitive behaviour therapy, are much more
        effective than medications in managing anxiety disorders in the long term. Your doctor may prescribe a brief
        course of tranquillisers or antidepressants to help you deal with your symptoms while other treatment options
        are given a chance to take effect.</p>

    <h3>Support groups and education</h3>
    <p>Support groups allow people with anxiety to meet in comfort and safety, and give and receive support. They also
        provide the opportunity to learn more about anxiety and to develop social networks.</p>
