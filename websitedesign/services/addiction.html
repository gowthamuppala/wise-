    <h1>ADDICTION:</h1>
    <p>Today, most experts recognize two types of addiction:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Chemical addiction:</b> This refers to addiction that involves the use of substances.</li>
        <li><b>Behavioral addiction:</b>This refers to addiction that involves compulsive behaviors. These are
            persistent,
            repeated behaviors that you carry out even if they don’t offer any real benefit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How addiction generally works</h2>
    <p>Before getting into the different types of addiction, it’s helpful to understand a few general elements of
        addiction.</p>
    <h3>The reward system</h3>
    <p>Addiction interferes with normal brain function, particularly in the reward system.
        When you do something you find enjoyable, whether that’s hanging out with your best friend, drinking a bottle of
        wine, or using cocaine, this reward system releases the neurotransmitter dopamine along with other chemicals.
    </p>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, dopamine doesn’t appear to actually cause feelings of pleasure or euphoria. Instead,
        it seems to reinforce your brain’s association between certain things and feelings of pleasure, driving you to
        seek those things out again in the future.</p>
    <h3>Cravings and tolerance</h3>
    <p>The desire to experience this euphoria again can trigger cravings for the substance or behavior, especially when
        you encounter the same cues (like a party where people are drinking, for example). These cravings often serve as
        the first sign of addiction.
        As you continue using a substance or engaging in a behavior, your brain continues to produce larger amounts of
        dopamine. Eventually, it recognizes that there’s plenty of dopamine in your brain already and starts producing
        less in response to normal triggers.</p>
    <p>There’s one problem, though: Your brain’s reward system still needs the same amount of dopamine to function as
        it should.
        Before long, you need to use more of the substance to make up for what your brain isn’t releasing. This effect
        is called tolerance.</p>
    <h3>Disinterest in other activities</h3>
    <p>As addiction develops, it’s common to lose interest in hobbies and other things you once enjoyed.
        This happens because your brain no longer produces much dopamine in response to natural triggers, like having
        sex or making art.
        Even when you want to stop using a substance or engaging in a behavior, you might feel like you still need them
        in order to feel good about anything.
    </p>
    <h3>Loss of control</h3>
    <p>Addiction usually involves an inability to control substance use or specific behaviors. This can result in job
        loss, health issues, and relationship concerns, among other things.
        In response, you might decide to quit the substance or behavior, only to find that you keep falling short,
        despite your best efforts.
    </p>
    <h2>What to know about chemical addiction</h2>
    <p>Chemical addiction can be tricky to talk about because there’s often confusion around what constitutes substance
        misuse, dependency, and addiction.
        This is partly why the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
        recommends using the term “substance use disorder.” This classification includes more diagnostic criteria to
        help healthcare professionals differentiate between mild, moderate, and severe cases.</p>
    <p> Many experts also prefer it because it avoid terms like “abuse,” which can further stigmatize addiction and
        prevent people from seeking help.
        Common symptoms of substance use disorder include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cravings intense enough to affect your ability to think about other things</li>
        <li>a need to use more of the substance to experience the same effects</li>
        <li>unease or discomfort if you can’t easily access the substance</li>
        <li>risky substance use, like driving or working while using it</li>
        <li>trouble managing work, school, or household responsibilities because of substance use</li>
        <li>friendship or relationship difficulties related to substance use</li>
        <li>spending less time on activities you used to enjoy</li>
        <li>an inability to stop using the substance</li>
        <li>withdrawal symptoms when you try to quit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of the more common addictive substances include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>alcohol</li>
        <li>opioids, including both heroin as well as prescription pain medication like oxycodone and morphine</li>
        <li>nicotine</li>
        <li>amphetamines</li>
        <li>cocaine</li>
        <li>methamphetamine</li>
        <li>cannabis</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What to know about behavioral addiction</h2>
    <p>There’s some disagreement around the concept of behavioral addictions and whether they truly involve addiction.
        However, the DSM-5 now recognizes two behavioral addictions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>gambling addiction</li>
        <li>internet gaming disorder</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While most medical experts agree certain behavior patterns can become problematic over time, but there’s still
        some debate around:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the point when behaviors become addictions
        <li>specific behaviors that can become addictive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, some may agree that shopping, sex, and exercise addictions exist but question the idea that people
        can become addicted to Facebook.
        The APA chose not to include these behavior patterns in the DSM-5, citing the lack of scientific, peer-reviewed
        evidence necessary to develop standard criteria for diagnosis.</p>
    <p>As a result, there’s no official diagnostic criteria.
        However, general signs of a potential behavioral addiction include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>• spending large amounts of time engaging in the behavior</li>
        <li>urges to engage in the behavior even if it negatively affects daily life, responsibilities, or relationships
        </li>
        <li>using the behavior to manage unwanted emotions</li>
        <li>hiding the behavior or lying to other people about time spent on it</li>
        <li>difficulty avoiding the behavior</li>
        <li>irritability, restlessness, anxiety, depression, or other withdrawal symptoms when attempting to quit</li>
        <li>feeling compelled to continue the behavior even when it causes distress</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Common behavioral addictions people often seek therapy and other professional support to address include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>shopping addiction</li>
        <li>exercise addiction</li>
        <li>food addiction</li>
        <li>sex addiction</li>
        <li>TV addiction</li>
        <li>Facebook (social media) addiction</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Symptoms and Causes</h2>
    <h3>What are the signs of addiction?</h3>
    <p>Symptoms of addiction vary from person to person and based on the substance or activity. In general, signs
        include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Inability to stop:</b> People may use a substance or engage in harmful addictive behavior even if they
            want to
            stop. They may have tried multiple times to reduce the substance use or behavior but can’t. They may also
            lie to their loved ones about it or try to hide it.</li>
        <li><b>Increased tolerance:</b> Over time, they may need more of the substance or activity to feel the same
            euphoric
            effects as they did before.</li>
        <li><b>Intense focus on the substance or activity:</b> People with addictions become pathologically preoccupied
            with
            the substance or activity. They may feel that the addiction has taken over their lives, as they spend more
            and more time craving, obtaining and thinking of the subject of the addiction.</li>
        <li><b>Lack of control:</b> They may feel like they’ve lost complete control over their substance use or
            activity and
            often feel helpless. They may often feel guilty, depressed and/or overwhelmed by their addiction and how
            much it’s impacted their lives.</li>
        <li><b>Personal problems and health issues:</b> Addiction impacts all aspects of their lives, including their
            physical
            health, mental health, personal relationships and career. They may have issues fulfilling responsibilities
            at work, school or home due to substance use or the activity. Again, despite knowing the detrimental effects
            their addictions are having on them, they can’t stop.</li>
        <li><b>Withdrawal: </b>People with addiction may experience emotional and physical withdrawal symptoms when they
            stop
            using. Physical symptoms include shaking, sweating or vomiting. They may also become anxious or irritable.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Overcome Addiction</h2>
    <p>Overcoming an addiction is a process that requires making the decision to quit, planning how you will quit,
        dealing with the effects of withdrawal, and avoiding relapse.
        With addiction, you want to make sure that you set yourself for success. That means if you are trying to avoid
        alcohol, in the beginning of your recovery journey, avoid places where you know there will be alcohol.
    </p>
    <h2>Ways to Overcome Addiction</h2>
    <p>Some other strategies for quitting an addiction include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Prepare to quit:</b> Before you quit, think about what you will need to do in order to give up your
            addiction.
            This might include eliminating triggers in your environment and finding social support.</li>
        <li><b>Consider medications to treat addiction: </b>If you have an alcohol or drug addiction, there are
            medications
            that can help you quit safely and successfully.5 Talk to your doctor about these options when you are
            planning to quit.</li>
        <li><b>Consider your environment:</b> Get rid of anything that might remind you of your addiction or trigger a
            craving.
            In some cases, you may find that you need to change your routines (like avoiding bars or restaurants where
            you used to drink) or social patterns (such as not hanging out with people you used to drink or use drugs
            with).</li>
        <li><b>Find distractions:</b> Staying busy can be a helpful way to distract yourself from cravings and
            temptations to
            relapse. Plan what you can do when a craving hits. For example, you might go for a walk, read a book, watch
            a television show, or call a friend.</li>
        <li><b>Get support:</b> Talk to the people who are close to you about your plan and ask them for support.
            Knowing that
            there are people in your corner who are willing to help you cope with the challenges of quitting can help
            you feel more encouraged when you are facing difficulties</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Treatments for substance use disorder</h2>
    <p>It’s often extremely difficult to quit or control substance use alone without support from a trained
        professional.
        The first step of treatment for some forms of substance use disorder, including those that involve alcohol,
        benzodiazepines, and heroin, typically involves medically supervised detoxification. This won’t treat the
        condition, but it can help people get through the withdrawal process safely.
        From there, one (or a combination of) the following is usually recommended.
    </p>
    <h3>Residential treatment</h3>
    <p>Rehab, or residential treatment, involves staying at a treatment facility where trained treatment specialists
        provide medical attention and support. Some programs only last a few weeks, while others might last several
        months to a year.
        Many rehab programs also incorporate elements of the following treatment approaches.
    </p>
    <h3>Therapy</h3>
    <p>Psychotherapy and addiction counseling can help with recovery, especially if someone started using substances to
        deal with distressing emotions.
        A therapist can help them explore some of the reasons behind their substance use and come up with new coping
        strategies for dealing with challenges.
    </p>
    <h3>Medication</h3>
    <p>In some cases, medication can help people working through addiction have greater success with recovery.
        It can be particularly helpful for preventing relapses in people dealing with substance use disorder involving
        alcohol, nicotine, or opioids. These medications work in different ways, but they generally help reduce cravings
        for the substance and reduce symptoms of withdrawal.
        Treatment providers typically recommend using medication in combination with other treatment approaches, like
        therapy, to address underlying factors.
    </p>
    <h3>Support groups</h3>
    <p>Twelve-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous help many people achieve recovery. These
        programs rely on self-help treatment methods and involve anonymous group support from other people working
        toward recovery.
        Comfort and guidance from others working toward recovery can make a lot of difference. However, these programs
        typically don’t provide enough support on their own. Plus, the 12-step model doesn’t work for everyone.
        Other programs, such as SMART Recovery, may be a better option for people looking for a more scientific approach
        to group support.
    </p>
    <h2>Treatments for behavioral addictions</h2>
    <p>As with chemical addiction, many different factors can contribute to behavioral addictions. Treatment approaches
        can vary, but therapy is usually the first recommendation.</p>
    <h3>Therapy</h3>
    <p>A type of therapy known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) if often most helpful for behavioral addictions.
        CBT focuses on paying attention to the thoughts and emotions that cause distress and learning how to reframe
        them in the moment. This, combined with more productive coping skills, can reduce the need for addictive
        behaviors.
        Other types of therapy can also help address underlying issues that might play a role in behavioral addiction,
        like relationships concerns.
    </p>
    <h3>Other treatments</h3>
    <p>Self-help groups and other types of peer support can help with behavioral addiction, especially when used in
        combination with therapy.</p>
