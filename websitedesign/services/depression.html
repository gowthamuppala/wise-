    <h1>DEPRESSION:</h1>
    <p>It’s important to realize that feeling down at times is a normal part of life. Sad and upsetting events happen to
        everyone. But if you’re feeling down or hopeless on a regular basis, you could be dealing with depression.
    </p>

        alt="image" class="main-image">
    <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
    <p>If you experience some of the following signs and symptoms of depression nearly every day for at least 2 weeks,
        you may be living with depression:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>feeling sad, anxious, or “empty”</li>
        <li>feeling hopeless, worthless, and pessimistic</li>
        <li>crying a lot</li>
        <li>feeling bothered, annoyed, or angry</li>
        <li>loss of interest in hobbies and interests you once enjoyed</li>
        <li>decreased energy or fatigue</li>
        <li>difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions</li>
        <li>moving or talking more slowly</li>
        <li>difficulty sleeping, early morning awakening, or oversleeping</li>
        <li>chronic physical pain with no clear cause that does not get better with treatment (headaches, aches or
            pains, digestive problems, cramps)</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>DEPRESSION TEST:</h2>
    <p>There isn’t a single test to diagnose depression. But your healthcare provider can make a diagnosis based on your
        symptoms and a psychological evaluation.</p>
    <p>In most cases, they’ll ask a series of questions about your:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>moods</li>
        <li>appetite</li>
        <li>sleep pattern</li>
        <li>activity level</li>
        <li>thoughts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because depression can be linked to other health problems, your healthcare professional may also conduct a
        physical examination and order blood work. Sometimes thyroid problems or a vitamin D deficiency can trigger
        symptoms of depression.</p>
    <p>It’s important not to ignore symptoms of depression. If your mood doesn’t improve or gets worse, seek medical
        help. Depression is a serious mental health illness with the potential for complications.

    </p>
    <p>If left untreated, complications can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>weight gain or loss</li>
        <li>physical pain</li>
        <li>substance use disorder</li>
        <li>panic attacks</li>
        <li>relationship problems</li>
        <li>relationship problems</li>
        <li>thoughts of suicide</li>
        <li>self-harm</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Types of depression</h1>
    <p>Depression can be broken into categories depending on the severity of symptoms. Some people experience mild and
        temporary episodes, while others experience severe and ongoing depressive episodes.</p>
    <p>There are two main types: major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder.</p>
    <h2>Major depressive disorder</h2>
    <p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the more severe form of depression. It’s characterized by persistent feelings
        of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness that don’t go away on their own.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>feeling depressed most of the day</li>
        <li>loss of interest in most regular activities</li>
        <li>significant weight loss or gain</li>
        <li>sleeping a lot or not being able to sleep</li>
        <li>slowed thinking or movement</li>
        <li>fatigue or low energy most days</li>
        <li>fatigue or low energy most days</li>
        <li>loss of concentration or indecisiveness</li>
        <li>recurring thoughts of death or suicide</li>

    </ul>
    <p>There are different subtypes of major depressive disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association refers to
        as “specifiers.”</p>
    <p>These include</p>
    <ul>
        <li>atypical features</li>
        <li>anxious distress</li>
        <li>mixed features</li>
        <li>peripartum onset, during pregnancy or right after giving birth</li>
        <li>seasonal patterns</li>
        <li>melancholic features</li>
        <li>psychotic features</li>
        <ii>catatonia</ii>
    </ul>
    <h2>Persistent depressive disorder</h2>
    <p>Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) used to be called dysthymia. It’s a milder, but chronic, form of depression.
    </p>
    <p>In order for the diagnosis to be made, symptoms must last for at least 2 years</p>
    <p>PDD can affect your life more than major depression because it lasts for a longer period.</p>
    <p>It’s common for people with PDD to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>lose interest in normal daily activities</li>
        <li>feel hopeless</li>
        <li>lack productivity</li>
        <li>have low self-esteem</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Depression can be treated successfully, but it’s important to stick to your treatment plan.</p>
    <p>Living with depression can be difficult, but treatment can help improve your quality of life. Talk to your
        healthcare professional about possible options.</p>

    <h2>Postpartum depression</h2>
    <p>Postpartum depression refers to depression that happens after childbirth. It is a common disorder after
        pregnancy, affecting 1 in 9 new parents.</p>
    <p>It’s common for people to experience “baby blues,” or feelings of sadness or emptiness after childbirth. For
        many people, these symptoms go away in a couple of days.</p>
    <p>But if you feel sad, hopeless, or empty for longer than 2 weeks post-childbirth, you may have postpartum
        depression.</p>
    <p>Symptoms of postpartum depression can range from mild to severe and can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>feeling restless or moody</li>
        <li>feeling sad, hopeless, or overwhelmed</li>
        <li>having thoughts of hurting the baby or yourself</li>
        <li>not having an interest in the baby, feeling disconnected, or as if your baby is someone else’s</li>
        <li>having no energy or motivation</li>
        <li>eating too little or too much</li>
        <li>sleeping too little or too much</li>
        <li>having trouble focusing</li>
        <li>having memory problems</li>
        <li>feeling worthless, guilty, or like a bad parent</li>
        <li>withdrawing from activities you once enjoyed</li>
        <li>withdrawing from friends and family</li>
        <li>having headaches, aches, or stomach issues that don’t go away</li>
        <li>feeling empty, unconnected, or as though you might not love or care for the baby</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Postpartum depression is thought to be triggered by the dramatic hormonal changes that take place after
        pregnancy.
        Bipolar depression occurs in certain types of bipolar disorder when a person experiences a depressive episode.
    </p>
    <p>Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that causes distinct changes in mood, energy, concentration, and the
        ability to carry out your day-to-day tasks.</p>
    <p>There are three types of bipolar disorder, all of which include periods known as manic episodes, where you feel
        extremely “up,” elated, or energized, and depressive episodes where you feel “down,” sad, or hopeless.
        If you have bipolar disorder, it can be hard to recognize the harmful effects of each “mood episode.”</p>
    <p>People having a depressive episode may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>feel very sad, hopeless, or empty</li>
        <li>feel slowed down or restless</li>
        <li>have trouble falling asleep, wake up too early, or sleep too much</li>
        <li>have an increased appetite and weight gain</li>
        <li>talk very slowly, forget things, or feel like they have nothing to say</li>
        <li>have trouble concentrating or making decisions</li>
        <li>feel unable to do basic tasks</li>
        <li>have little interest in activities</li>
        <li>have a decreased or absent sex drive</li>
        <li>have thoughts of death or suicide</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Symptoms during a depressive episode last every day for most of the day and can last for several days or weeks.
        If bipolar disorder is treated, many will experience fewer and less severe symptoms of depression, if they
        experience depressive episodes.
    </p>
    <h1>Treatment for depression</h1>
    <p>Depression is unlikely to simply go away on its own. In fact, if ignored and left untreated, depression can go on
        for months, sometimes years, and can have many negative effects on a person’s life.
        Every person needs to find the treatment that’s right for them. It can take time and patience to find a
        treatment that works.<br>
        Different types of depression require different treatment. Mild symptoms may be relieved by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>learning about the condition </li>
        <li>lifestyle changes (such as regular physical exercise)</li>
        <li>psychological therapy provided by a mental health professional or via online e-therapies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For moderate to more severe depression, medical treatments are likely to be required, in combination with these
        other treatments.
        Treatment for depression should start with seeing your doctor. Book an extended consultation to give you time to
        discuss your symptoms and treatment options. Your doctor may ask you to fill out a screening questionnaire or
        conduct some tests to rule out other conditions.
        Your doctor may refer you to a psychologist, social worker, counsellor or psychiatrist. You can access a rebate
        to see most of these professionals through Medicare. This requires that your doctor writes you a GP Mental
        Health Plan – ask them for more details.
    </p>
    <p>Other treatment options include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>your local community health centre – speak to someone at your local council for contact details. </li>
        <li>your local mental health service triage service – they can give you advice about your closest major hospital
            with a psychiatric department with staff available for mental health assessments.
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Psychological treatments for depression</h2>
    <p>Psychological treatments (also known as talking therapies) have been found to be an effective way to treat
        depression. They can help you change your thinking patterns and improve your coping skills so you're better
        equipped to deal with life's stresses and conflicts.
        As well as supporting your recovery, psychological therapies can help you stay well by identifying and changing
        unhelpful thoughts and behaviour.<br>
        There are several different types of psychological treatments including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)</li>
        <li>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</li>
        <li>behaviour therapy</li>
        <li>mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>CBT is one of the most commonly used psychological therapies. It helps people with depression to monitor and
        change negative patterns of thinking and improve their coping skills so they are better equipped to deal with
        life’s stresses and conflicts.</p>
    <h2>Antidepressant medications</h2>
    <p>The main medical treatment for depression is antidepressant medication. Antidepressant medication may be
        prescribed, along with psychological treatments, when a person experiences a moderate to severe episode of
        depression. Sometimes, antidepressants are prescribed when other treatments have not been successful or when
        psychological treatments are not possible due to the severity of the condition or a lack of access to the
        treatment.</p>
    <p>People with more severe forms of depression (bipolar disorder and psychosis) generally need to be treated with
        medication. This may include one or a combination of mood stabilisers, antipsychotic drugs and antidepressants.
    </p>
    <p>There are many types of antidepressants. Making a decision about which antidepressant is best for a person can be
        complex. The decision is made in consultation with a doctor, after careful assessment and consideration.
        Antidepressants take at least two weeks before they start to help, and it may also take some time for the doctor
        to find the most suitable medication and dosage.</p>
    <p>Antidepressants can make people feel better, but they won’t change their personality or make them feel happy all
        the time. As with any other medication, some people will experience some side-effects.</p>
    <p>Common side-effects, depending on which medication is taken, include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>nausea</li>
        <li>headaches</li>
        <li>anxiety</li>
        <li>sweating</li>
        <li>sweating</li>
        <li>agitation</li>
        <li>weight gain</li>
        <li>dry mouth</li>
        <li>sexual difficulties (for example, difficulty becoming or staying aroused).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of these sympThe length of time a person needs to take antidepressants for depends on the severity of the
        condition and how they respond to treatment. Antidepressants are safe, effective and not addictive. Stopping
        medication should only be done gradually, on a doctor’s recommendation and under supervision.toms can be
        short-lived, but people who experience any of these symptoms should tell their doctor, as there are ways of
        minimising them. The likelihood of a particular side-effect happening varies between people and medication.</p>

    <p>Every person needs to find the treatment that’s right for them. Just because a treatment has been shown to work
        scientifically doesn’t mean it will work equally well for every person. Some people will have complications,
        experience side-effects or find that the treatment does not fit in with their lifestyle. It can take time and
        patience to find a treatment that works</p>
    <p>After seeking appropriate advice, the best approach is to try a treatment you’re comfortable with and one that
        works for most people. If you do not recover quickly enough, or experience problems with the treatment, discuss
        this with your health professional and consider trying another option.</p>
    <h1>Depression – coping and recovering</h1>
    <p>While psychological and medical treatment can help with a person’s recovery, there are many other ways people can
        help themselves to get better and stay well.</p>
    <h2> Staying active</h2>
    <p>When you are depressed, you may not enjoy activities that you once loved. You may also think you won’t enjoy
        something but, when you do it, you actually enjoy it more than you expected.
        If you don’t try activities, you reduce the number of things that may help you cope with your depression. To
        increase the amount of activities you enjoy, you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>list activities you used to enjoy – include as many as possible</li>
        <li>plan one of these activities each day</li>
        <li>increase the amount of time available for activities you enjoy</li>
        <li>after an activity, think about or write down what you enjoyed about it</li>
        <li>talk to others about what activities they like.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you keep going, it will help you get better. You will enjoy activities more as you recover.</p>
    <h2>Sleeping patterns and depression</h2>
    <p>Depression can disrupt sleep patterns. It’s essential to try to restore a regular sleep pattern to make a full
        recovery. Some tips for restoring a regular sleep pattern include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to go to sleep and get up at about the same time each day.</li>
        <li>If you’re worrying about things during the night, set aside some time for problem solving during the day.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid drinking caffeine after 4 pm and try not to drink more than two cups of caffeine-type drinks (such as
            coffee, strong tea, cola or energy drinks) each day.</li>
        <li>Avoid using alcohol to help you sleep. As the alcohol is broken down in your body, it causes you to sleep
            less deeply and to wake more frequently.</li>
        <li>Allow yourself time to wind down before going to bed. If you are working or studying, stop at least 30
            minutes before bedtime and do something relaxing.</li>
        <li>Give your mind a break from online activity such as social media for an hour before bedtime, and consider
            putting your phone in a separate room from your bedroom at night time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Negative thoughts and depression.</h2>
    <p>Worrying or thinking negatively is common in people with depression. This affects your ability to focus on
        getting better and makes you more vulnerable to unhealthy emotions.
        Tips to help you control worry and reduce negative thinking include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write down what you are worried about. Go through each concern and think about how realistic your negative
            thoughts are. Explore alternative thoughts and explanations.</li>
        <li>Try not to focus on the things you cannot change.</li>
        <li>Focus on the present. Accept your thoughts without actively engaging with them.</li>
        <li>Avoid making major decisions about your life at this time.</li>
        <li>Write down your problems and brainstorm solutions. Jot down the pros and cons with each option and choose
            the one that seems the best. Review whether it worked to overcome the problem.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Dealing with irritability</h2>
    <p>Some people with depression may experience irritability. These feelings can become worse because of changes in
        sleeping patterns and lifestyle.
        Help yourself to deal with this by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>telling your friends, family and colleagues what you are going through and that you may appear to be
            irritable</li>
        <li>if you feel yourself getting angry, stopping and taking some time out to settle yourself down</li>
        <li>practising regular relaxation to reduce the effects of irritating or frustrating situations</li>
        <li>talking to people who are supportive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many people with depression can also simultaneously experience anxiety conditions. In most cases the treatment
        for anxiety is similar to the treatment for depression, but it is important to tell your doctor or mental health
        professional about any anxiety symptoms so they tailor the treatment to both conditions.</p>
    <p>Psychotherapy, also known as “talk therapy,” is when a person speaks to a trained therapist to identify and learn
        to cope with the factors that contribute to their mental health condition, such as depression.</p>
