    <h1>MARRIAGE</h1>
    <p>Have you been sitting and wondering why is marriage hard? Have marriage problems made you question your
        relationship and whether or not it would last?</p>
    <p>Marriages can be challenging for most people as it involves melding your life and goals with someone else’s.
        Marriage problems after kids or other major changes can be challenging to deal with and can lead to resentment
        and feelings of disappointment.</p>
    <p>Marriage problems, however, are often a result of complacent behavior and oversight. These problems can be
        resolved with the right approach and openness to reflect. </p>

    <h2>marriage problems</h2>
    <h3>1.Infidelity</h3>
    <p>Infidelity is one of the most common marriage problems in relationships. The most recent data suggests that about
        20 percent of interviewed men admitted to cheating on their partner compared to 10 percent of women. It includes
        cheating and having emotional affairs.</p>
    <p>Other instances included in infidelity are one-night stands, physical infidelity, internet relationships, and
        long and short-term affairs. Infidelity occurs in a relationship for many different reasons; it is a common
        problem and one that various couples are struggling to find a solution to.</p>
    <h3>2.Sexual differences</h3>
    <p>Physical intimacy is indispensable in a long-term relationship, but it’s also the root cause of one of the most
        common marriage problems of all time, sexual problems. Sexual problems can occur in a relationship for several
        reasons paving the way for subsequently more marriage problems.</p>
    <p>Studies reveal that sexual compatibility, along with sexual satisfaction, was cited as the most crucial factor in
        determining relationship satisfaction for couples.</p>
    <p>The most common sexual problem within a marriage is a loss of libido. Many people are under the impression that
        only women experience issues with libido, but men also experience the same. </p>
    <p>In other instances, sexual problems can be due to the sexual preferences of a spouse. One person in the
        relationship may prefer different sexual things than the other spouse, making the other spouse uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <h3>3.Values and beliefs</h3>
    <p>Certainly, there will be differences and disagreements within a marriage, but some differences are too
        significant to ignore, such as core values and beliefs. One spouse may have one religion, and the other may have
        a different belief. </p>
    <p>Differences in values may lead to an emotional chasm, among other common marriage problems. 
        As you may have guessed, this could cause significant trouble when one spouse gets tired of doing things
        separately, such as going to different places of worship.</p>
    <p>Such marriage problems are widespread in cross-cultural marriages. Other differences include core values.
        These include the way children are reared and the things they were taught during their childhood, such as the
        definition of right and wrong. 
        Since everyone does not grow up with the same belief systems, morals, and goals, there is much room for debate
        and conflict within the relationship.</p>
    <h3>4.Life stages</h3>
    <p>Many people do not consider their life stages when it comes to a relationship.
        In some instances, marriage issues occur simply because both spouses have outgrown each other and want more out
        of life from someone else.</p>
    <p>Growing apart with time is a common issue among married couples who have a significant age gap, whether it is an
        older man and younger woman or older woman and younger man.</p>
    <p>Personalities change with time, and couples might not remain as compatible as they once might have been. Couples
        with an age difference who are in different phases of life face this common marriage problem.</p>
    <h3>5.Traumatic situations</h3>
    <p>When couples go through traumatic incidents, it adds more challenges in marriage.
        Traumatic situations are other problems that couples may experience.  A lot of traumatic events that occur are
        life-changing.
        These traumatic situations become problems for some married couples because one spouse does not know how to
        handle the situation at hand.</p>
    <p>One spouse may not know how to function without the other due to being in the hospital or on bed rest. In other
        situations, one spouse may require around-the-clock care, causing them to be solely dependent on the other
        spouse.
        Sometimes, the pressure is too great, and the responsibility is too much to deal with, so the relationship
        spirals downward until it comes to a complete end.</p>
    <h3>6.Stress</h3>
    <p>Stress is a common marriage problem that most couples will face at least once within their relationship. Many
        different situations can cause stress within relationships and instances, including financial, family, mental,
        and illness.</p>
    <p>Financial problems can stem from a spouse losing their job or being demoted from their job. Stress from family
        can include children, problems with their family, or the spouse’s family. Many different things trigger stress.
    </p>
    <h3>7.Boredom</h3>
    <p>Boredom is a severe but underrated marital problem.
        With time some spouses become bored with their relationship. They may get tired of the things that occur within
        the relationship. In this situation, it comes down to being bored with the relationship because it has become
        predictable. </p>
    <p>A couple may do the same thing every day without change or a spark. A spark usually consists of doing random
        things from time to time. If a relationship lacks spontaneous activities, there is good chance boredom will
        become a problem.</p>
    <h3>8.Jealousy</h3>
    <p>Jealousy is another common marriage problem that causes a marriage to turn sour. Being with them and around them
        can become a challenge if you have an overly jealous partner.</p>
    <p>Jealousy is suitable for any relationship to an extent, as long as it is not overly jealous. Such individuals
        will be overbearing: they may question who you are talking to on the phone, why you are talking to them, how you
        know them and how long you have known them, etc.
        Having an overly jealous spouse can strain the relationship; a lot of stress will eventually end such a
        relationship.</p>
    <h3>9.Trying to change each other</h3>
    <p>This common relationship problem occurs when couples overstep their partner’s boundaries to mold their beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>It does happen that such disregard for your partner’s boundaries might happen by mistake; the extent of
        retaliation from the spouse that is being attacked is usually appeased in time.</p>
    <h3>10.Communication problems</h3>
    <p>Lack of communication is one of the most common problems in marriage. 
        Communication encompasses both verbal and non-verbal cues, which is why even if you have known someone for a
        long time, a slight change in the facial expression or any other form of body language can be misunderstood.</p>
    <p>Men and women communicate very differently and can fall into a habitat of improper communication. If such
        relationship or marriage issues are allowed to fester, then the sanctity of marriage is definitely at stake. 
        Healthy communication is the foundation for success in marriage.</p>
    <h3>11.Lack of attention</h3>
    <p>Humans are social creatures and are avid seekers of attention from others, especially those closest to them.
        Every marriage, over time, suffers a common relationship problem, ‘lack of attention,’ where a couple,
        intentionally or unintentionally, redirects their attention to other aspects of their lives.</p>
    <p>Lack of attention changes the chemistry of marriage, which instigates one or the spouse to act out and overreact.
        This problem in marriage, if not dealt with appropriately, can then spiral out of control.</p>
    <h3>12.Financial issues</h3>
    <p>Nothing can break a marriage faster than money. If you are opening a joint account or handling your finances
        separately, you will encounter financial problems in your marriage. It is essential to discuss any financial
        issues as a couple openly.</p>
    <h3>13.Lack of appreciation</h3>
    <p>A lack of gratitude, recognition, and acknowledgment of your spouse’s contribution to your relationship. 
        Your inability to appreciate your spouse can be detrimental to your relationship.</p>
    <h3>14.Technology and social media</h3>
    <p>The emerging dangers of social media on marriage and family are imminent.
        With a rapid increase in our interaction and obsession with technology and social platforms, we are moving
        further away from healthy face-to-face communication.</p>
    <p>We are losing ourselves in a virtual world and forgetting to love other people and things around us. Such
        fixation has quickly become a common marriage problem.</p>
    <h3>15.Trust issues</h3>
    <p>This common marriage trouble can rot your marriage from the inside, leaving no chance of restoring your
        relationship.</p>
    <p>The idea of trust in a marriage is still very conventional and, at times, puts too much strain on a marriage when
        the doubt starts to seep into a relationship.</p>
    <h3>16.Selfish behavior</h3>
    <p>Even though selfishness can be efficiently dealt with by making minor changes in your attitude towards your
        spouse, it is still a widespread marriage problem.</p>
    <p>A big part of being in a relationship is melding your life with another person and their priorities. Couples
        often find this transition difficult as collective priorities can clash with personal ones, which can cause
        problems.</p>
    <h3>17.Anger issues</h3>
    <p>Losing your temper, shouting or screaming in rage, and causing physical harm to yourself or your spouse is sadly
        a common marriage problem.</p>
    <p>With increasing stress due to internal and external factors and in a fit of rage, we might be unable to control
        our anger, and an outburst towards our loved ones can be very harmful to a relationship. </p>
    <h3>18.Keeping score</h3>
    <p>When anger get the best of us in a marriage, a widespread reaction is vengeful or seeking retribution from your
        spouse.
        Keeping count of battles won and lost within a relationship can set the foundation for an unhealthy
        relationship. It would make you want to settle the score constantly and lead to resentment. The priority then
        becomes having the upper hand rather than being there for each other.</p>
    <h3>19.Lying</h3>
    <p>Lying as a common marriage problem isn’t only restricted to infidelity or selfishness; it also comprises white
        lies about day-to-day things. These lies are many times used to save face and not let your spouse get the high
        ground.</p>
    <p>Couples might lie to each other about the difficulties or problems they might be facing at work or in other
        social scenarios; such marriage problems burden a relationship. When things get out of hand, it can very much
        wreck a marriage.</p>
    <h3>20.Unrealistic expectations</h3>
    <p>To some extent, we all agree with the notion that marriage is forever, but still, we fail to put in the time and
        effort to understand our partners before getting married.
        We draw our inspirations of a perfect marriage from stories that we have heard or from people that we know
        without even questioning if both of us want the same things in life or not.</p>
    <p>A mismatch between a couple about the future outlook of a relationship creates a lot of room for a build-up of
        unrealistic expectations from our partner.
        These expectations, when not fulfilled, breed resentment, disappointments and push marriage down a path from
        where there might be no recovery.</p>
    <h3>21.Ignoring boundaries</h3>
    <p>While it is okay to point out certain things that your partner can improve about themselves, it may not be the
        best idea to pester them into changing too much or overstepping boundaries they have set. This can become a
        marriage problem if not checked in time.</p>
    <h3>22.Emotional infidelity</h3>
    <p>Infidelity can be of various types. However, the one that mostly comes to light is physical infidelity – when a
        partner has physical relationships with one or multiple people outside the marriage or relationship.</p>
    <p>However, emotional infidelity is when a partner develops romantic feelings for someone other than their partner.
        Emotional infidelity can also become a marriage problem since feelings for someone else can damage your marriage
        or relationship.</p>
    <h3>23.Division of labor</h3>
    <p>Are the chores in your marriage divided equally or fairly? If not, it can become a big problem in your marriage. 
    </p>
    <h3>24.Power inequality</h3>
    <p>An inequality of power in your relationship or marriage could become a problem in your marriage. Power could be
        financial or just about the dynamics of your relationship.</p>
    <h3>25.Difference in expression</h3>
    <p>Do you love your partner? Yes. But does your partner feel loved by you? Maybe.</p>
    <p>One of the common marriage problems is when there is a difference in the expression of love. You and your partner
        don’t need to show love in the same way, and therefore, it can lead to misunderstandings.</p>
    <h2>How can couples encountering problems in their marriage overcome them?</h2>
    <p>What are some ways couples can overcome the problems in their marriage? While specific solutions to each problem
        are mentioned above, here are some tips on making things better between the two of you.</p>
    <h3>1.Communicate</h3>
    <p>Communication is really the key. It might sound repetitive, but most things can be solved through communication.
        You cannot expect your partner to read your mind. You must speak as clearly as you can about your problems,
        expectations, and needs.</p>
    <h3>2.Take a break</h3>
    <p>We do not realize how important it is to take a break from a fight or even each other. Taking a breather can help
        you recognize what requires your energy or not. Most often, we end up in a heated argument because we cannot
        think clearly, and taking some time off helps us understand the other person’s point of view.</p>
    <h3>3.Remember that you are a team</h3>
    <p>When you fight or argue, remember that you both are against the problem, and not you two against each other. You
        are a team, and you must make decisions together. </p>
