    <h1>obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD)</h1>
    <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a condition in which you have frequent unwanted thoughts
        and sensations (obsessions) that cause you to perform repetitive behaviors (compulsions).
        The repetitive behaviors can significantly interfere with social interactions and performing daily tasks.</p>
    <p>OCD is usually a life-long (chronic) condition, but symptoms can come and go over time.</p>
    <img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/09/394401-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-cycle-body-1296x1330-1-998x1024.jpg"
        alt="image" class="main-image">
    <p>
        Everyone experiences obsessions and compulsions at some point. For example,
        it’s common to occasionally double-check the stove or the locks.
        People also often use the phrases “obsessing” and “obsessed” very casually in everyday conversations.
        But OCD is more extreme. It can take up hours of a person’s day.
        It gets in the way of normal life and activities. Obsessions in OCD are unwanted, and people with OCD don’t
        enjoy performing compulsive behaviors.
    </p>

    <h2>What is the difference between OCD and OCPD?</h2>
    <p>Even though they sound similar, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
        (OCPD) are
        different conditions.</p>
    <h3>Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD)</h3>
    <p>Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) involves an extensive preoccupation with perfectionism,
        organization and control. People with OCPD have rigid beliefs and need to have control of themselves,
        others and situations.</p>
    <p>People with OCPD have rigid beliefs and specific ways of doing different tasks. They don’t allow for any
        flexibility and are unable to compromise with others.
        People with OCPD often don’t realize their behavior and way of thinking are problematic.</p>

    <h3>obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</h3>
    <p>OCD is an anxiety disorder in which you have frequent unwanted and intrusive thoughts (obsessions) that cause you
        to perform repetitive behaviors (compulsions).
        Examples of compulsions include flipping a light switch a certain number of times or repeatedly washing your
        hands.</p>
    <p>People with OCD usually are aware that the condition is causing their behavior and accept that they need
        professional help to treat it.
        People with OCPD usually have little, if any, self-awareness of their behaviors.</p>


    <h2> symptoms of OCPD</h2>
    <p>The main sign of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a pervasive preoccupation (obsession) with order,
        perfectionism, control and specific ways of doing things.
        These behaviors make it difficult to complete tasks and cause issues with relationships.</p>
    <p>Symptoms of OCPD usually begin by early adulthood.</p>
    <p>A person with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be preoccupied with and insist on details, rules, lists, order and organization.</li>
        <li>Have perfectionism that interferes with completing tasks.</li>
        <li>Have excessive devotion to work and productivity. This results
            in neglecting hobbies and spending less time with loved ones.</li>
        <li>Have excessive doubt and indecisiveness.</li>
        <li> Use extreme caution to avoid what they perceive to be failure.</li>
        <li> Be rigid and stubborn in their beliefs and ways of doing things.</li>
        <li>Be unwilling to compromise.</li>
        <li>Be unwilling to throw out broken or worthless objects, even if they have no sentimental value.</li>
        <li>Have difficulty working with others or delegating tasks unless they agree to do things exactly as the person
            wants.</li>
        <li>Frequently become overly fixated on a single idea, task or belief.</li>
        <li>Perceive everything as “black or white” (dichotomous thinking).</li>
        <li>Have difficulty coping with criticism.</li>
        <li>Over-focus on flaws in other people.</li>






    </ul>

    <h2> symptoms of OCD</h2>
    <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder usually includes both obsessions and compulsions. But it's also possible to have
        only obsession symptoms or only compulsion symptoms. You may or may not know that your obsessions and
        compulsions are beyond reason.
        But they take up a great deal of time, reduce your quality of life, and get in the way of your daily routines
        and responsibilities.</p>

    <h3>Obsession symptoms</h3>
    <p>OCD obsessions are lasting and unwanted thoughts that keeping coming back or urges or images that are intrusive
        and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by acting based on ritual.
        These obsessions usually intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things.</p>
    <p>Obsessions often have themes, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fear of contamination or dirt.</li>
        <li> Doubting and having a hard time dealing with uncertainty.</li>
        <li> Needing things to be orderly and balanced.</li>
        <li> Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others.</li>
        <li>Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects.</li>



    </ul>
    <p>Examples of obsession symptoms include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched.</li>
        <li>Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove.</li>
        <li>Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way.</li>
        <li>Images of driving your car into a crowd of people.</li>
        <li>Thoughts about shouting obscenities or not acting the right way in public.</li>
        <li>Unpleasant sexual images.</li>
        <li> Staying away from situations that can cause obsessions, such as shaking hands.</li>



    </ul>


    <h3>Compulsion symptoms</h3>
    <p>OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to do. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts
        are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening.
        But taking part in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only limited relief from anxiety.</p>
    <p>You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts.
        These compulsions are beyond reason and often don't relate to the issue they're intended to fix.</p>
    <p>As with obsessions, compulsions usually have themes, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Washing and cleaning.</li>
        <li> Checking.</li>
        <li> Counting.</li>
        <li>Ordering.</li>
        <li> Following a strict routine.</li>
        <li>Demanding reassurance.</li>


    </ul>
    <p>Examples of compulsion symptoms include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw.</li>
        <li> Checking doors over and over again to make sure they're locked.</li>
        <li>Checking the stove over and over again to make sure it's off.</li>
        <li>Counting in certain patterns.</li>
        <li>Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase.</li>
        <li>Trying to replace a bad thought with a good thought.</li>
        <li>Arranging your canned goods to face the same way.</li>



    </ul>


    <h2>Complications</h2>
    <p>Issues due to obsessive-compulsive disorder include:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Excessive time spent taking part in ritualistic behaviors.</li>
        <li>Health issues, such as contact dermatitis from frequent hand-washing.</li>
        <li>Having a hard time going to work or school or taking part in social activities.</li>
        <li>Troubled relationships.</li>
        <li>Poor quality of life.</li>
        <li>Thoughts about suicide and behavior related to suicide.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <p>There's no sure way to prevent obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, getting treated as soon as possible may
        help keep OCD from getting worse
        and disrupting activities and your daily routine.</p>

    <h3>Living With</h3>
    <p>practicing self-care can help manage your symptoms. Examples include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li> Getting quality sleep.</li>
        <li>Exercising regularly.</li>
        <li>Eating a healthy diet.</li>
        <li>Spending time with loved ones who support you and understand OCD.</li>
        <li>Practicing relaxation techniques, such as meditation, yoga, massage and visualization.</li>
        <li>Joining an in-person or online support group for people who have OCD</li>




    </ul>
    <h2>Talking therapy</h2>
    <h3>When to consult a therapist</h3>
    <p>There's a difference between being a perfectionist — someone who needs flawless results or performance — and
        having OCD.
        OCD thoughts aren't simply excessive worries about real issues in your life or liking to have things clean or
        arranged in a
        specific way.</p>

    <p>If your obsessions and compulsions affect your quality of life, see your doctor or mental health professional.
    </p>

    <p>Talking therapy involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>working with your therapist to break down your problems into their separate parts, such as your
        thoughts,
        physical feelings and actions</li>
        <li>encouraging you to face your fears and have obsessive thoughts without neutralising them with compulsive
            behaviours; you
            start with situations that cause the least anxiety first, before moving on to more difficult thoughts</li>
    </ul>
    <P>The treatment may be hard work, but many people find that when they confront their obsessions, the
        anxiety eventually improves or goes away.</P>
