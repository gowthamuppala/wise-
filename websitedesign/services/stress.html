    <h1>STRESS</h1>
    <p>Stress is how we react when we feel under pressure or threatened.
        It usually happens when we are in a situation that we don't feel we can manage or control.</p>
    <p>“It's overwhelming. Sometimes you can't see beyond the thick fog of stress.”</p>

    <h2>What causes stress?</h2>
    <p>Many things can cause stress. You might feel stressed because of one big event or situation in your life. Or it
        might be a build-up of lots of smaller things.
        This might make it harder for you to identify what's making you feel stressed, or to explain it to other people.
    </p>
    <p>You may experience stress if you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feel under lots of pressure</li>
        <li>Face big changes in your life</li>
        <li>Are worried about something</li>
        <li>Don't have much or any control over the outcome of a situation</li>
        <li>Have responsibilities that you find overwhelming</li>
        <li>Don't have enough work, activities or change in your life</li>
        <li>Experience discrimination, hate or abuse</li>
        <li>Are going through a period of uncertainty</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is stress management?</h2>
    <p>It may seem like there’s nothing you can do about stress. The bills won’t stop coming, there will never be more
        hours in the day, and your work and family responsibilities will always be demanding. But you have a lot more
        control than you might think.
        If you’re living with high levels of stress, you’re putting your entire well-being at risk. Stress wreaks havoc
        on your emotional equilibrium, as well as your overall physical and mental health. It narrows your ability to
        think clearly, function effectively, and enjoy life.</p>
    <p>Effective stress management helps you break the hold stress has on your life, so you can be happier, healthier,
        and more productive. The ultimate goal is a balanced life, with time for work, relationships, relaxation, and
        fun—and the resilience to hold up under pressure and meet challenges head on.
        But stress management is not one-size-fits-all.That’s why it’s important to experiment and find out what works
        best for you. The following stress management tips can help you do that.</p>
    <h2>Tip 1: Identify the sources of stress in your life</h3>
        <p>Stress management starts with identifying the sources of stress in your life. This isn't as straightforward
            as it sounds. While it's easy to identify major stressors such as changing jobs, moving, or going through a
            divorce, pinpointing the sources of chronic stress can be more complicated.
            It's all too easy to overlook how your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors contribute to your everyday
            stress levels.Sure, you may know that you're constantly worried about work deadlines, but maybe it's your
            procrastination, rather than the actual job demands, that is causing the stress.</p>
        <p>To identify what's really stressing you out, look closely at your habits, attitude, and excuses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do you explain away stress as temporary (“I just have a million things going on right now”) even though
                you can’t remember the last time you took a breather?</li>
            <li>Do you define stress as an integral part of your work or home life (“Things are always crazy around
                here”) or as a part of your personality (“I have a lot of nervous energy, that’s all”)?</li>
            <li>Do you blame your stress on other people or outside events, or view it as entirely normal and
                unexceptional?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Until you accept responsibility for the role you play in creating or maintaining it, your stress level will
            remain outside your control.</p>
        <h3>Start a stress journal</h3>
        <p>A stress journal can help you identify the regular stressors in your life and the way you deal with them.
            Each time you feel stressed, make a note of it in your journal or use a stress tracker on your phone.
            Keeping a daily log will enable you to see patterns and common themes. Write down:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What caused your stress (make a guess if you’re unsure).</li>
            <li>How you felt, both physically and emotionally.</li>
            <li>How you acted in response.</li>
            <li>What you did to make yourself feel better.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tip 2: Cut out unhealthy ways of dealing with stress</h2>
        <p>Many of us feel so stressed out, we resort to unhealthy and unproductive ways to cope. A lot of these
            unhelpful strategies can temporarily reduce stress, but in the long run, they actually cause even more
            damage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Smoking, drinking too much, or using drugs to relax.</li>
            <li>Bingeing on junk or comfort food.</li>
            <li>Zoning out for hours in front of the TV or phone.</li>
            <li>Withdrawing from friends, family, and social activities.</li>
            <li>Sleeping too much.</li>
            <li>Filling up every minute of the day to avoid facing problems.</li>
            <li>Procrastinating.</li>
            <li>Taking out your stress on others (lashing out, angry outbursts, physical violence).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your methods of coping with stress aren’t contributing to your greater emotional and physical health, it’s
            time to find healthier ones that leave you feeling calm and in control.</p>
        <h2>Tip 3: Practice the 4 A's of stress management</h2>
        <p>While stress is an automatic response from your nervous system, some stressors arise at predictable times:
            your commute to work, a meeting with your boss, or family gatherings, for example. When handling such
            predictable stressors, you can either change the situation or change your reaction.
            When deciding which option to choose in any given scenario, it's helpful to think of the four
            A's: avoid, alter, adapt, or accept.</p>
        <h3>Avoid unnecessary stress</h3>
        <p>It's not healthy to avoid a stressful situation that needs to be addressed, but you may be surprised by the
            number of stressors in your life that you can eliminate.
            Learn how to say “no.” Know your limits and stick to them. Whether in your personal or professional life,
            taking on more than you can handle is a surefire recipe for stress.
            Avoid people who stress you out. If someone consistently causes stress in your life, limit the amount of
            time you spend with that person, or end the relationship.
            Take control of your environment. If the evening news makes you anxious, turn off the TV. If traffic makes
            you tense, take a longer but less-traveled route. If going to the market is an unpleasant chore, do your
            grocery shopping online.</p>
        <p>Avoid hot-button topics. If you get upset over religion or politics, cross them off your conversation list.
            If you repeatedly argue about the same subject with the same people, stop bringing it up or excuse yourself
            when it’s the topic of discussion.
            Pare down your to-do list. Analyze your schedule, responsibilities, and daily tasks. If you’ve got too much
            on your plate, distinguish between the “shoulds” and the “musts.” Drop tasks that aren’t truly necessary to
            the bottom of the list or eliminate them entirely.</p>
        <h3>Alter the situation</h3>
        <p>If you can't avoid a stressful situation, try to alter it. Often, this involves changing the way you
            communicate and operate in your daily life.
            Express your feelings instead of bottling them up. If something or someone is bothering you, communicate
            your concerns in an open and respectful way. If you don't voice your feelings, resentment will build and the
            stress will increase.</p>
        <p>Be willing to compromise. When you ask someone to change their behavior, be willing to do the same. If you
            both are willing to bend at least a little, you'll have a good chance of finding a happy middle ground.</p>
        <P>Be more assertive. Don’t take a backseat in your own life. Deal with problems head on, doing your best to
            anticipate and prevent them. If you’ve got an exam to study for and your chatty roommate just got home, say
            up front that you only have five minutes to talk.</P>
        <P>Find balance. All work and no play is a recipe for burnout. Try to find a balance between work and family
            life, social activities and solitary pursuits, daily responsibilities and downtime.</P>
        <h3>Adapt to the stressor</h3>
        <p>If you can't change the stressor, change yourself. You can adapt to stressful situations and regain your
            sense of control by changing your expectations and attitude.</p>
        <p>Reframe problems. Try to view stressful situations from a more positive perspective. Rather than fuming about
            a traffic jam, look at it as an opportunity to pause and regroup, listen to your favorite radio station, or
            enjoy some alone time.</p>
        <p>Look at the big picture. Take perspective of the stressful situation. Ask yourself how important it will be
            in the long run. Will it matter in a month? A year? Is it really worth getting upset over? If the answer is
            no, focus your time and energy elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Adjust your standards. Perfectionism is a major source of avoidable stress. Stop setting yourself up for
            failure by demanding perfection. Set reasonable standards for yourself and others, and learn to be okay with
            “good enough.”</p>
        <p>Practice gratitude. When stress is getting you down, take a moment to reflect on all the things
            you appreciate in your life, including your own positive qualities and gifts. This simple strategy can help
            you keep things in perspective.</p>
        <h3>Accept the things you can't change</h3>
        <p>Some sources of stress are unavoidable. You can't prevent or change stressors such as the death of a loved
            one, a serious illness, or a national recession. In such cases, the best way to cope with stress is to
            accept things as they are.
            Acceptance may be difficult, but in the long run, it's easier than railing against a situation you can't
            change.</p>
        <p>Don't try to control the uncontrollable. Many things in life are beyond our control, particularly the
            behavior of other people. Rather than stressing out over them, focus on the things you can control such as
            the way you choose to react to problems.</p>
        <p>Look for the upside. When facing major challenges, try to look at them as opportunities for personal growth.
            If your own poor choices contributed to a stressful situation, reflect on them and learn from your mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>Learn to forgive. Accept the fact that we live in an imperfect world and that people make mistakes. Let go of
            anger and resentments. Free yourself from negative energy by forgiving and moving on.</p>
        <p>Share your feelings. Expressing what you're going through can be very cathartic, even if there's nothing you
            can do to alter the stressful situation. Talk to a trusted friend or make an appointment with a therapist.
        </p>
        <h2>Tip 4: Get moving</h2>
        <p>When you're stressed, the last thing you probably feel like doing is getting up and exercising. But physical
            activity is a huge stress reliever—and you don't have to be an athlete or spend hours in a gym to experience
            the benefits.
            Exercise releases endorphins that make you feel good, and it can also serve as a valuable distraction from
            your daily worries.</p>
        <p>While you'll get the most benefit from regularly exercising for 30 minutes or more, it's okay to build up
            your fitness level gradually. Even very small activities can add up over the course of a day.
            The first step is to get yourself up and moving. Here are some easy ways to incorporate exercise into your
            daily schedule:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Put on some music and dance around.</li>
            <li>Take your dog for a walk.</li>
            <li>Walk or cycle to the grocery store</li>
            <li>Use the stairs at home or work rather than an elevator.</li>
            <li>Park your car in the farthest spot in the lot and walk the rest of the way.</li>
            <li>Pair up with an exercise partner and encourage each other as you work out.</li>
            <li>Play ping-pong or an activity-based video game with your kids.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Deal with stress with mindful rhythmic exercise</h3>
        <p>While just about any form of physical activity can help burn away tension and stress, rhythmic activities are
            especially effective. Good choices include walking, running, swimming, dancing, cycling, tai chi, and
            aerobics.
            But whatever you choose, make sure it's something you enjoy so you're more likely to stick with it.</p>
        <p>While you're exercising, make a conscious effort to pay attention to your body and the physical (and
            sometimes emotional) sensations you experience as you're moving. Focus on coordinating your breathing with
            your movements, for example, or notice how the air or sunlight feels on your skin.
            Adding this mindfulness element will help you break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that often
            accompanies overwhelming stress.</p>
        <h2>Tip 5: Connect to others</h2>
        <p>There is nothing more calming than spending quality time with another human being who makes you feel safe and
            understood. In fact, face-to-face interaction triggers a cascade of hormones that counteracts the body's
            defensive “fight-or-flight” response.
            It's nature's natural stress reliever (as an added bonus, it also helps stave off depression and anxiety).
            So make it a point to connect regularly—and in person—with family and friends.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that the people you talk to don't have to be able to fix your stress. They simply need to be
            good listeners. And try not to let worries about looking weak or being a burden keep you from opening up.
            The people who care about you will be flattered by your trust. It will only strengthen your bond.
            Of course, it's not always realistic to have a pal close by to lean on when you feel overwhelmed by stress,
            but by building and maintaining a network of close friends you can improve your resiliency to life's
            stressors.</p>
        <h3>Tips for building relationships</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reach out to a colleague at work.</li>
            <li>Help someone else by volunteering.</li>
            <li>Have lunch or coffee with a friend.</li>
            <li>Ask a loved one to check in with you regularly.</li>
            <li>Call or email an old friend.</li>
            <li>Go for a walk with a workout buddy.</li>
            <li>Schedule a weekly dinner date.</li>
            <li>Meet new people by taking a class or joining a club.</li>
            <li>Confide in a clergy member, teacher, or sports coach.</li>
            <li>Join a support group—either in-person or via on online therapy platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tip 6: Make time for fun and relaxation</h2>
        <p>Beyond a take-charge approach and a positive attitude, you can reduce stress in your life by carving out “me”
            time. Don't get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of life that you forget to take care of your own
            needs. Nurturing yourself is a necessity, not a luxury.
            If you regularly make time for fun and relaxation, you'll be in a better place to handle life's stressors.
        </p>
        <p>Set aside leisure time. Include rest and relaxation in your daily schedule. Don’t allow other obligations to
            encroach. This is your time to take a break from all responsibilities and recharge your batteries.
            Do something you enjoy every day. Make time for leisure activities that bring you joy, whether it be
            stargazing, playing the piano, or working on your bike.
            Keep your sense of humor. This includes the ability to laugh at yourself. The act of laughing helps your
            body fight stress in a number of ways.</p>
        <p>Take up a relaxation practice. Relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, and deep breathing activate
            the body's relaxation response, a state of restfulness that is the opposite of the fight or flight or
            mobilization stress response.
            As you learn and practice these techniques, your stress levels will decrease and your mind and body will
            become calm and centered.</p>
        <h2>Tip 7: Manage your time better</h2>
        <p>Poor time management can cause a lot of stress. When you're stretched too thin and running behind, it's hard
            to stay calm and focused. Plus, you'll be tempted to avoid or cut back on all the healthy things you should
            be doing to keep stress in check, like socializing and getting enough sleep.
            The good news: there are things you can do to achieve a healthier work-life balance.</p>
        <p>Don't over-commit yourself. Avoid scheduling things back-to-back or trying to fit too much into one day. All
            too often, we underestimate how long things will take.</p>
        <p>Prioritize tasks. Make a list of tasks you have to do, and tackle them in order of importance. Do the
            high-priority items first. If you have something particularly unpleasant or stressful to do, get it over
            with early. The rest of your day will be more pleasant as a result.</p>
        <p>Break projects into small steps. If a large project seems overwhelming, make a step-by-step plan. Focus on
            one manageable step at a time, rather than taking on everything at once.</p>
        <p>Delegate responsibility. You don't have to do it all yourself, whether at home, school, or on the job. If
            other people can take care of the task, why not let them? Let go of the desire to control or oversee every
            little step. You'll be letting go of unnecessary stress in the process.</p>
        <h2>Tip 8: Maintain balance with a healthy lifestyle</h2>
        <p>In addition to regular exercise, there are other healthy lifestyle choices that can increase your resistance
            to stress.</p>
        <p>Eat a healthy diet. Well-nourished bodies are better prepared to cope with stress, so be mindful of what you
            eat. Start your day right with breakfast, and keep your energy up and your mind clear with balanced,
            nutritious meals throughout the day.</p>
        <p>Reduce caffeine and sugar. The temporary “highs” caffeine and sugar provide often end with a crash in mood
            and energy. By reducing the amount of coffee, soft drinks, chocolate, and sugar snacks in your diet, you’ll
            feel more relaxed and you’ll sleep better.</p>
        <p>Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. Self-medicating with alcohol or drugs may provide an easy escape from
            stress, but the relief is only temporary. Don’t avoid or mask the issue at hand; deal with problems head on
            and with a clear mind.</p>
        <p>Get enough sleep. Adequate sleep fuels your mind, as well as your body. Feeling tired will increase your
            stress because it may cause you to think irrationally.</p>
        <h2>Tip 9: Learn to relieve stress in the moment</h2>
        <p>When you're frazzled by your morning commute, stuck in a stressful meeting at work, or fried from another
            argument with your spouse, you need a way to manage your stress levels right now. That's where quick stress
            relief comes in.</p>
        <p>The fastest way to reduce stress is by taking a deep breath and using your senses—what you see, hear, taste,
            and touch—or through a soothing movement. By viewing a favorite photo, smelling a specific scent, listening
            to a favorite piece of music, tasting a piece of gum, or hugging a pet, for example, you can quickly relax
            and focus yourself.</p>
        <h3>Talking therapy</h3>
        <p>Talking with a trained professional could help you find ways to deal with stress. And it can help you become
            more aware of your own thoughts and feelings.
            You might also find talking therapies helpful if your stress has caused other mental health problems.</p>
        <p>There are lots of different talking therapies. Some of them may help you. But not all of them will be
            suitable for your situation. Our pages on talking therapy and counselling have lots more information about
            different types of therapy.</p>
