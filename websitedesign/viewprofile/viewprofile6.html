            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am Dr.Vineesha Shetty, a trauma informed, solicitous and perceptive Counselling Psychologist with a Master's degree in Clinical Psychology. With a natural inclination towards keen observation, I am driven by the desire to assist individuals, as well as myself, in discovering alternative and more fulfilling ways of leading a meaningful life through a deep understanding of human psychology.

                As an empathetic counsellor, I consistently strive to instil hope in individuals and empower them to recognize their inherent potential. My area of expertise lies in supporting individuals with emotional well-being and addressing various mental health concerns such as family and relationship issues, stress management, general anxiety, exam-related anxiety, depression, self-development, and conducting comprehensive mental status examinations.

            </p>

            <p>

                Proficient in conducting case histories, employing the mental status examination (MSE) technique, and employing active listening skills, I ensure that clients feel genuinely understood and supported throughout the therapeutic process. Moreover, I have received specialised training in evidence-based modalities such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Toxic Relationship Psychotherapy, and Psycho-Oncology.
